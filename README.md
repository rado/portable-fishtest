Portable Fishtest for Windows
=============================

This is portable version of Fishtest for Windows ready to use out of the box. Just download the package, extract it anywhere on your computer, and you are ready to help make Stockfish even better.

Compared to the original version of Fishtest you will not install anything on your computer (the package already includes portable Python), so it's easy to use for every user, even if you don't have Administrator account on your machine.

What is Fishtest
----------------

From https://stockfishchess.org/get-involved/ :
>Fishtest lets you volunteer your computer's processing power to help test future versions of Stockfish. No coding required! All you need to do is install the Fishtest worker, and your computer will automatically start playing chess games using future and current versions of the engine.

Troubleshooting
---------------

Fishtest takes full advantage of 64-bit machines for efficiency and high computational power. Unfortunately, it is most likely that it will not run on older/slower machines with 32-bit Windows.
